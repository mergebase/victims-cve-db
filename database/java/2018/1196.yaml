title: "Spring by Pivotal: Symlink privilege escalation attack via Spring Boot launch script"
description: >
    Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be used to easily run the application as a systemd or init.d linux service. The script included with Spring Boot 1.5.9 and earlier is susceptible to a symlink attack which allows the "run_user" to overwrite and take ownership of any file on the same system.
    In order to instigate the attack, the application must be installed as a service and the "run_user" requires shell access to the server.
    Spring Boot application that are not installed as a service, or are not using the embedded launch script are not susceptible.
